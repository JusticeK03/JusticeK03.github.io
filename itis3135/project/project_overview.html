        <h3><strong>Dynamic Functionality:</strong> Photo Gallery</h3>
        <p>I found an interesting interactive photo gallery with a lightbox feature and will add it to the “Projects” page. Users will be able to click through project screenshots to view them in a larger, centered model, with navigation buttons to cycle through images. This allows users to explore my clients projects without leaving the page.
            <br>Similar but not the same to <a href="Charlotte.edu/research">Charlotte.edu/research</a> page where its almost a slide show.
