    <h2>ITIS 3135 : Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and raised near Belmont, NC. I grew up in a rural area without a lot of access to technology. I mostly spent my time outside and playing sports. I like playing soccer, skateboarding (you can probably catch me at the star quad most days), I do like playing video games and reading as well. I don’t plan on getting a tech job out of college but I plan on joining the Navy to hopefully pilot helicopters. </li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> UPS Store Clerk 2018-2021 and 2021-2022 (different stores)</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I enrolled at UNC Charlotte in 2021 and initially was a Business Administration major and I thought that it was very boring and wanted to find something more interesting. I changed my major Fall 2022 to Comp Sci  because friends said it was good and you can make a lot of money with it.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows </li>
            <li><strong>Courses I’m Taking, and Why:</strong>

                </ol></li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by:</strong> I own a 1971 Volkswagen bus named VooDoo  </li>
            <li><strong>I’d Also Like to Share:</strong> I am a Skater so you’ll probably find me hanging around the Star Quad</li>
        </ul>
